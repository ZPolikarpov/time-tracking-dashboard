Live Site URL: [Live Site](https://zpolikarpov.github.io/time-tracking-dashboard/)

## Built With
- **Vite** - A fast frontend build tool for modern web development
- **React** - JavaScript library for building user interfaces
- **SCSS** - CSS preprocessor for writing cleaner and more maintainable styles
- **HTML** - Markup language for structuring the website
- **JavaScript (JS)** - For dynamic behavior and interactivity

## Features
- **Fully Responsive Design**: Adapts seamlessly to different screen sizes and devices.
- **Pixel-Perfect Implementation**: Faithful to the original Figma design provided.
- **Interactive Elements**: Includes dynamic behaviors for an engaging user experience.
